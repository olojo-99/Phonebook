With the GCC compiler, the C program can be compiled within a UNIX-based CLI by typing "gcc -o phonebook.c phonebook". The executable can then be ran by typing "./phonebook".

The Java program can be compiled to bytecode by typing "javac phonebook.java" and executed within a JVM by typing "java phonebook".

Alternatively, both programs can be compiled with the makefile using the commnand "make".
